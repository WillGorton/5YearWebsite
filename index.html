                    This site holds most of our memories together all the laughs, awkward stages, and best moments we've 
                    shared over the years. <br>
                    From that first piece of homework, to our most recent visits, each photo and video
                    holds a part of our history. <br>
                    I've organized everything by year so you can watch us grow together, one precious moment at a time, <br>there might
                    be some things missing but I'm sure we can work on this together in the future to make sure theres no gaps.<br>
                    <br>
                    I love you always, happy 5 years My Love.

                <p>I I hope you can enjoy the scroll through our journey together. You wouldn't believe the amount of times I had chuckled and smiled, reminisced and felt grateful. Every single photo and memory holds a special place in my heart and I can't wait to see what adventures we'll share next!</p>
